Interesting things i had to do
    -   I had to remove a 'isLoading' UI feature because the blocking aspect of items
        very nature, makes Snipcart throw an error.

        See Snipcart order validation: https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/setup/order-validation 

        "Unfortunately if you re-engage ‘isLoading’ our order validation process will 
        fail as it works the same way we fetch products."


Quesitons
    -   Not sure if my PWA is set up properly. On the index page under getStaticProps, 
        I prefetchQuery and then i also feth the same data as to pass it in props so i  
        can then use those values in the intitial state. Is this right to do? Or am I 
        just double fetching the data?
